# InternetPresence
Have you ever wanted to see your internet presence in full? Well, now you can do so, in an easy-to-do manner!

## How to find Usernames
For this, just run `py usernames.py` in `/scripts/`. It'll install everything you need, and then allow you to run Sherlock on the usernames you give it.

You can search for either one username, or multiple.

It'll keep asking you for usernames until you tell it to stop. To stop, write any of these: `n`, `N`, `no`, `No`.

You can find the output of Sherlock in  the `username/` directory.

## How to find Emails
To do this, run `py email.py` in `/scripts/`. If you do not have `holehe` installed, please install it using [https://github.com/megadose/holehe#with-github](https://github.com/megadose/holehe#with-github)

It'll ask you for Phone Numbers until you say one of these: `n`, `N`, `no`, `No`. Make sure to do newlines after each one unlike for usernames.

The output will go to `phone.txt`.

## How to find Phone Numbers
To do this, run `py phone.py` in `/scripts/`. If you do not have `ignorant` installed, please install it using [https://github.com/megadose/ignorant#with-github](https://github.com/megadose/ignorant#with-github)

It'll ask you for Emails until you say one of these: `n`, `N`, `no`, `No`. Make sure to do newlines after each one unlike for usernames.

The output will go to `email.txt`.

## ALL
To do both Emails and Phone Numbers at the same time, run `py main.py`. It'll just run the scripts but all at once.
Username isn't compatible with it yet, though.
